What is Open Source Software(OSS)?

Open Source Software is a computer software whose source code is made publicly available for modification and enhancements. 
It is released under various licenses like BSD, MIT etc. “What is open source?” is a good read.

I strongly believe that reading few lines of code is worth more than reading 500 pages of a book. 
When you follow code written by great programmers, you automatically tend to pickup some great practices while coding.

Even before I studied the subject Software Engineering in college, I had practical knowledge of version control systems,
debuggers, issue trackers, continuous integration tools and this was all because of contributing to open source projects.

There are many advantages to contributing to open source - You can make a great resume that stands out from the crowd. 
It helps you in building online presence.

But, these merry words won't help you get started..
How do I get started?

First and foremost, you must choose a programming language of your choice. Once you are done with selecting a programming language,
search for a project that is interesting to you.

Open Hatch is perfect for beginners. The search page of Open Hatch filters out bugs based on
- Languages
- Projects
Mozilla has a wide range of projects filtered based on programming language. What can I do for Mozilla?
How do I filter out a bug?

Honestly, finding a bug for a beginner is really a hard. I faced the same problems. But I will be listing down resources on how 
to find easy bugs and get started with contributing to a large organization.
